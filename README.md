 9.**Agriguard**:Created a system to detect plant diseases in agricultural fields using machine learning and computer vision techniques. The model leverages image processing and classification algorithms to identify common plant diseases from images, providing farmers with timely insights for crop management and disease prevention. The system aims to enhance crop health monitoring, reduce pesticide use, and improve agricultural productivity.
